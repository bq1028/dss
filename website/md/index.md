DSS (_Deterministc StyleSheets_) is a component-oriented CSS authoring system that compiles to high-performance _Atomic CSS_-based stylesheets. Thanks to the DSS compiler and a simple `classNames` helper, DSS styles are resolved in deterministc way which respects on the application order.

DSS is similar to CSS Modules and it is language agnostic. Styles are authored in static `.css` files, compiled down to atomic classes for small bundle size and then consumed in any language (Ruby, PHP, Python etc) that implements the super simple `classNames` helper.

Given two class names that set the `color` to `red` and `green`:

```css
.foo {
  color: red;
}
.bar {
  color: green;
}
```

when applied to an element one wins over the other depending on which order the classes are applied:

```html
<!-- green -->
<div class="foo bar">hello</div>

<!-- red -->
<div class="bar foo">hello</div>
```

Such a feature makes it possible to tell with **confidence** which rules apply and/or overrule others at a given point in time.

This website is styled with DSS and its source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/giuseppeg/dss/tree/master/website). We also have a handful of [examples](https://github.com/giuseppeg/dss/tree/master/examples).

## Features

* ‚ö°Ô∏è Automatic compilation to Static Atomic CSS classes and high-performance stylesheets
* üÜé Deterministic styles resolution - styles are always resolved in application order
* üåé Framework and language agnostic
* üíª Standalone CLI and support for Webpack 3 and 4 with automatic vendor prefixing

## Atomic CSS and smaller bundles

The DSS compiler converts every CSS declaration to an atomic CSS class and returns a JSON object that contains mappings to the source rules.

```css
// index.css

.foo {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  color: red;
}

.bar {
  display: flex;
  color: green;
}
```

Is compiled to:

```JSON
{
 "foo": [
    "dss_14e3233-fkmc3a",
    "dss_1uacqdt-m23pbg",
    "dss_rfc3hq-169mlyl"
  ],
  "bar": [
    "dss_14e3233-fkmc3a",
    "dss_rfc3hq-5rjgso"
  ]
}
```


When compiling multiple files, the JSON for each file should be written to disk and at the end of the compilation the atomic CSS generated by DSS is available via a `dss.flush()` call. The string returned by `flush` contains the entire app CSS.

```css
/* dss.flush() */

.dss_14e3233-fkmc3a{display:flex}
.dss_1uacqdt-m23pbg{flex-direction:column}
.dss_rfc3hq-169mlyl{color:red}
.dss_rfc3hq-5rjgso{color:green}
```

Since we are using atomic classes declarations are deduped and the final bundle size should be small-ish. Remember that with atomic CSS the file size growth is logarithmic, this means that DSS also solves the critical extraction problem out of the box.
